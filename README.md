# Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO)
The official code for the paper [Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13231.pdf). This paper is accepted by CVPR 2024ðŸŽ‰! D3PO can directly fine-tune the diffusion model through human feedback without the need to train a reward model. Our repository's code is referenced from [DDPO](https://github.com/kvablack/ddpo-pytorch).

# 1. Requirements
Python 3.10 or a newer version is required to install the necessary dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/yk7333/d3po.git
cd d3po
pip install -e .
```

# 2. Usage
We used `accelerate` to facilitate distributed training. Prior to executing our code, it is essential to configure the settings for `accelerate`:
```
accelerate config
```
Depending on your computer's capabilities, you can choose either single or multi-GPU training.

## 2.1 Training with Reward Model (Quantifiable Objectives)
To conduct experiments involving a reward model, you can execute the following command:
```
accelerate launch scripts/rm/train_d3po.py
```
![D3PO](figures/samples.png)
You can modify the prompt function and reward function in `config/base.py` to suit various tasks. For instance, you can employ ImageReward as the reward model and apply our method to enhance human preferences for images. If you want to reproduce our experiments, you can run *train_ddpo.py* and *train_dpok.py* to get the results.

## 2.2 Training without Reward Model
The training process without a reward model consists of two steps: sampling and training. First, run this command to generate image samples:
```
accelerate launch scripts/sample.py
```
The above command will generate a large number of image samples and save information such as each image's latent representation and prompt. The generated data will be stored in the `/data` directory. Subsequently, based on human feedback, annotations can be applied to the generated images. For this purpose, we deployed a website using [sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing](https://github.com/zanllp/sd-webui-infinite-image-browsing/issues?q=tag), where images can be annotated on a website.

After organizing human feedback results into a JSON file, you'll need to modify *sample_path* in `config/base.py` to the directory containing the image samples and adjust *json_path* to the directory of the JSON file. Then, execute the following command to proceed with the training:
```
accelerate launch scripts/train.py
```
The model will be fine-tuned during training based on human feedback, aiming to achieve the desired results. We conducted experiments to reduce image distortions, enhance image security, and perform prompt-image alignment. You can customize additional fine-tuning tasks based on your specific needs. The dataset for the image distortion experiments can be downloaded [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yangkaiSIGS/d3po_datasets/tree/main). Additionally, images generated from various fine-tuning methods in the prompt-image alignment experiment, along with human evaluations, can also be found in this repository.
